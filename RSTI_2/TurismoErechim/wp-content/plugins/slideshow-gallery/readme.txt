Feature content in a JavaScript powered slideshow gallery showcase on your WordPress website.


== Description ==

Feature content in beautiful and fast JavaScript powered slideshow gallery showcases on your WordPress website.

You can easily display multiple galleries throughout your WordPress website displaying your custom added slides, slide galleries or showing slides from WordPress posts/pages.

The slideshow is flexible, all aspects can easily be configured and embedding/hardcoding the slideshow gallery is a breeze. 

See the <a href="https://tribulant.net/slideshowgallery/">online demonstration</a>.


Here are several ways to display a slideshow: 


= Shortcode for all slides =

To embed a slideshow with all slides under **Slideshow > Manage Slides** in the plugin, simply insert the shortcode below into the content of a post/page.

`[tribulant_slideshow]`


= Shortcode for featured posts =

You can create a slideshow from featured posts, each post being a slide and it's featured image used as the slide image. The link of the slide will be the link of the post so clicking on the slide will take users to that post.

Here is a sample shortcode that you can use for this:

`[tribulant_slideshow featured="true" featurednumber="10" featuredtype="post"]`


= Shortcode for a gallery's slides =

To embed a slideshow with slides from a specific gallery under **Slideshow > Manage Galleries** in the plugin, simply insert the shortcode below (where X is the ID value of the gallery) into the content of a post/page.

`[tribulant_slideshow gallery_id="X"]`


= Shortcode for the images of a WordPress post/page =

To embed a slideshow with the images uploaded to a WordPress post/page through it's media gallery, simply insert the shortcode below (where X is the ID value of the post). Whether you want to display the images from a post or a page, the parameter remains `post_id`.

`[tribulant_slideshow post_id="X"]`


= Shortcode for latest/featured products =

In order to display latest or featured products in a slideshow, you need the <a href="https://tribulant.com/plugins/view/10/" title="WordPress Shopping Cart">Shopping Cart plugin</a> from Tribulant. Once you have this installed and activated, you can easily display recent or featured products. To display recent products use the shortcode below. 

`[tribulant_slideshow products="latest"]`

And to display featured products, use the one below. 

`[tribulant_slideshow products="featured"]`

For both, you can use the `productsnumber` parameter to limit the number of products eg. 

`[tribulant_slideshow products="latest" productsnumber="5"]`


= Hardcode into any plugin/theme with PHP =

To hardcode into any PHP file of your WordPress theme, simply use 

`<?php if (function_exists('slideshow')) { slideshow($output = true, $gallery_id = false, $post_id = false, $params = array()); } ?>`.


= Parameters for shortcode/hardcode to customize each slideshow =

You can use any of the following parameters with both the hardcoding and shortcode to customize each slideshow gallery:

Shortcode example 1: 
`[tribulant_slideshow layout="responsive" gallery_id="3" auto="true" navopacity="0" showthumbs="true"]`

Shortcode example 2: 
`[tribulant_slideshow layout="specific" post_id="379" width="600" height="300" auto="false" showinfo="false"]`

Hardcode example 1: 
`<?php slideshow(true, 3, false, array('layout' => "responsive", 'auto' => "true", 'navopacity' => "0", 'showthumbs' => "true")); ?>`

Hardcode example 2: 
`<?php slideshow(true, false, 379, array('layout' => "specific", 'width' => "600", 'height' => "300", 'auto' => "false", 'showinfo' => "false")); ?>`

This way you can customize each slideshow you embed or hardcode, despite the settings you saved under **Slideshow > Settings**.

== Installation ==

Installing the WordPress slideshow gallery plugin is very easy. Simply follow the steps below.

1. In WordPress, navigate to Plugins > Add New and upload it there (or search and install it there), and then skip to step 6. Or, for manual installation, extract the package to obtain the `slideshow-gallery` folder and continue below.

2. Upload the `slideshow-gallery` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

4. Configure the settings according to your needs through the **Slideshow > Settings** menu.

5. Add and manage your slides in the 'Slideshow' section.

6. Use `[tribulant_slideshow post_id="X"]` to embed a slideshow with the images of a post into your posts/pages or use `[tribulant_slideshow gallery_id="X"]` to display the slides of a specific gallery by ID or use `[tribulant_slideshow]` to embed a slideshow with your custom added slides under **Slideshow > Manage Slides** or `<?php if (function_exists('slideshow')) { slideshow($output = true, $gallery_id = false, $post_id = false, $params = array()); } ?>` into your WordPress theme using PHP code.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I display/embed multiple instances of the slideshow gallery? =
Yes, you can and you can add multiple slideshows on the same page as well.

= How can I display specific slides in a slideshow gallery instance? =
You can organize slides either into multiple galleries according to your needs or you can upload images to WordPress posts and display the images uploaded to a post.

= How do I display the images uploaded to a post? =
You can embed a slideshow and show the images uploaded to a post with the `post_id` parameter. Like this `[tribulant_slideshow post_id="123"]`.

= Can I exclude certain images from a post in the slideshow? =
Yes, you can use the `exclude` parameter to exclude post images by their order in the gallery (comma separated) like this `[tribulant_slideshow post_id="123" exclude="2,4,8"]`.

= How can I fix slide images or thumbnails not displaying? =
There is an "Images Tester" utility under Slideshow > Settings on the right-hand side. Use that to determine the problem.
